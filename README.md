# Parallel Universal Cellular Automata - Parallel Systems Second Project

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to develop a distributed version of a universal cellular automata based on an iterative stencil loop, where each machine communicates using OpenMPI.

The project is done in C using the mpi.h library.
